/* You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, 
you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move 
and therefore the other person will be the winner. Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

Example:

Input: s = "++++"
Output: true 
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

    }

        if (s[i] == '+' && s[i + 1] == '+') {
            
            s[i] = '-';
